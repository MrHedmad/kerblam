# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to kerblam!

We use issues to track what needs to be done.
If you'd like to contribute, pick an issue, comment that you'd like to work
on it, and send a pull request when you are done.

Please keep all conversations civil, and do not discriminate anyone for their
experience, race or ethnicity, social status, etc.

## About the code
Kerblam! is relatively simple. Start reading the `main.rs` file and follow
the imports.
Each command is split in its own file.
Simple commands are all collected in the `other` module, since they most often
only encompass a function or two.

Kerblam! uses [`anyhow`](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) to handle its `Result`s,
as most of the times we just want to end early, without special handling.

Any complex parts of the code should be commented and propely explained.
If you are unsure on what something does, and cannot decypher the code, please
open an issue - the code probably needs some refactoring if you feel that way.

### Code style
Code styling is left to `cargo fmt`. Please reformat your code before sending a
pull request, such as by adding this [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hook:
```yaml
default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, commit-msg]
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/doublify/pre-commit-rust
    rev: v1.0
    hooks:
    -   id: fmt
    -   id: cargo-check
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
```

## Testing
Tests are of two types, integration or unit tests. Both are run with `cargo test`.
Unit tests are your standard doc tests and unit tests, just write them in as
you'd normally would.

Kerblam! is also tested against [the kerblam-examples examples](https://github.com/MrHedmad/kerblam-examples).
Each example is in a directory (e.g. `examples/my_example`) with a `run` bash
script that runs the example and rolls it back.
`cargo test` checks out the *current* version of `kerblam-examples` and runs
the `run` scripts, checking:
- If the `run` script exited successfully;
- If the number or content of the files in the repo has changed from before
  the `run` script was executed.

To add a new example/test, write the example (see the `kerblam examples` repo),
add the `run` script to the example and add the `run_example_named!` or
`run_example_named!` macro with the name of the example and if you expect
it to succeed or fail, e.g. `run_example_named!("my_example", "success")`.

### Testing docker
Since CIs here on github are run in docker containers, there is a problem when
trying to test kerblam! on the cloud:

> The issue here is that when you run dockerized pipelines, the docker
> container is connected through a socket to the host container.
> Therefore, when we bind-mount paths inside the docker container, the bind
> fails since the host docker daemon does not "see" inside the runtime.
> It attempts to bind the local (on the host machine of Github) directory
> but it simply fails since it's not what we want to bind to, resulting
> in an empty mountpoint.
> 
> I think there is not easy solution here.
>
> - @MrHedmad

For this reason, all tests that run Docker at some point are wrapped in the
`run_ignored_example_named` macro instead. To run them locally, use
`cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

These example tests run locally on your machine, so you should make sure that you have
properly installed the requirements for kerblam! to run, including both docker
and podman executables.
If you find that one of these tests has failed, please be sure that it is not
due to your specific environment before starting the debug process.

## Cutting releases

When we are ready to push a new release, do the following:
- Check if `cargo dist` needs to be updated (update `cargo dist` via package manager, then
  run `cargo dist init` to apply the new configuration). Commit the change and push.
- Update `cargo.toml` with the new tag, commit the change and push.
- To trigger a release, push a tag to the `main` branch with the version that
  needs to be release.
  This triggers `cargo-dist` to build the binaries and installers and upload them
  to the release.
  - For example: `git tag v0.0.0 && git push --tags`
- To publish on `crates.io`, use `cargo publish` after triggering `cargo-dist`.
  - Wait until the `cargo dist` action on Github has concluded before pushing to crates.io.

And you're done! You might want to edit the release made automatically by
`cargo-dist` with more information, perhaps by adding a changelog.
