A Kerblam! project has a kerblam.toml file in its root, and enjoys
some nice perks:
- Allows for easy remote data access, by just specifying URLs and
  access tokens;
- Can package and export data quickly and easily to share the project
  with colleagues;
- Allows to manage and run multiple makefiles for different versions
  of the project;
- Leverages git to isolate, rollback and run the project at a different
  tag;
- Cleans up intermediate and output files quickly;
- Manages Docker environments and runs code in them for you.

To transform a project to a Kerblam! project just make the kerblam.toml
file yourself.
