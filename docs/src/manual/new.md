# Creating new projects - `kerblam new`

You can quickly create new kerblam! projects by using `kerblam new`.

Kerblam asks you some questions for setting up your project, and uses your
answer to pick sensible defaults.
For instance, if you say that you will use Python, it will create a virtual
environment for you (using `python-venv`) and pull the Github recommended
Python `.gitignore` for you.

Since Kerblam! assumes you use git, a new git repository will be initialized
for you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kerblam! will **NOT** do an `Initial commit` for you!
> You still need to do that manually once you've finished setting up.
