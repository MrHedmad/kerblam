Kerblam! is a Rust command line tool to manage the execution of scientific data
analysis, where having reproducible results and sharing the executed pipelines
is important. It makes it easy to write multiple analysis pipelines and select
what data is analysed.

With Kerblam! your analyses will be less bloated, more organized, and more
reproducible.
