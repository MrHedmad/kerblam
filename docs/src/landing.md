### Kerblam! is a **project management system** for data analysis projects.

Wherever you have input data that needs to be processed to obtain some output,
Kerblam! can help you out by dealing with the more tedious and repetitive parts
of working with data for you, letting you concentrate on getting things done.

Kerblam! lets you work reproducibly, rigorously and quickly for big and small
projects alike: from routine data analysis to large, multi-workflow projects.
